Eventi

Android native mobile app, made with Jetpack Compose UI Toolkit

The app gives the user an opportunity to choose their personal interests, which then it uses to fetch data about events of those interests from an API (https://docs.predicthq.com/start/api-quickstart) and displays them. Doing so, a preview about every event may be seen, giving the user more information and details about it. By attending those events, a memory is created and stored locally on the phone. The memories are also statistically represented by visually showing a chart(https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) that describes how many events of each interest has the user attended.

The app currently uses a static API key, because it's using a free trial that lasts 2 weeks, so it may not work on download, if the access token has expired!
